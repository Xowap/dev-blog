# My dev.to blog

Since I was sick of managing my dev.to articles through a web interface without any versioning, I'm putting everything in GitHub and I use [DEV-CLI](https://github.com/Xowap/DEV-CLI) to publish articles automatically.

If you want to read me, you can head to my [DEV profile](https://dev.to/xowap/)!

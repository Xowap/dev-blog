description: Deep down a lot of developers fear becoming irrelevant to this ever-changing industry. How can one get into a safer spot?
---

I have lately been reading a lot of comments and articles from other developers and I am getting the unmistakable feeling that a lot of us are frightened to become irrelevant. To get stuck 10 years on a shitty dusty stack that nobody wants anymore.

The more I was seeing those comments the more I started to realize that I have myself been stuck in the same old stack for almost 10 years. Indeed, my first Django application [was initiated](https://github.com/Xowap/Maiznet/commit/a959a0517d93acb91c237bafa90effb19010f453) in 2011, 8 years ago.

Yet, this is very contradictory to my inner feeling of using the best tool for the job. For me, Django was the best tool in 2011 and still is the best tool in 2019.

Which begs the question. Am I an old fart too sure of himself? Or am I a visionary genius capable of ever-lasting good decisions?

That is when I started thinking about what it meant to stay up-to-date as a developer.

## How fast does it move?

The premise of the whole "being outdated" idea is that technology is moving so fast that you can't keep up with it. Let's then evaluate the change rate of technology before moving deeper into this essay.

So, maybe we are talking about the platforms. Windows was released in 1985, Linux in 1991 and OS X in 2001 but it's more like a GUI on top of FreeBSD (1993)/Mach (1985). It looks like desktop/server operating systems are more or less 30 years old.

Could it be that we are talking about the web? Which was invented in 1989. It's taken up to about 2010 for HTML 5 to start kicking out. Most of the things we do today come with polyfills up to IE6 (2001). I'm not saying that you could do everything on IE6 but I'm pretty sure you could run a material-ish SPA in IE6.

Talking about SPAs, they appeared on my radar around 2012. The previous major change before that was AJAX in 2004. And before that it would be the apparition of JavaScript itself in 1995.

So yes, there is a zillion of frameworks doing exactly the same thing in different ways out there but SPAs are 8 years-old in my memory.

Based on the dates above, development paradigms seen to be shifting more or less every ten years. I see a lot of resume of people changing jobs every 2 years, it gives them the time for 5 jobs per "paradigm era".

## How much is there to learn?
